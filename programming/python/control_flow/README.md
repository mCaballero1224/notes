# Control Flow

Unlike love, code can be conditional. And there's several ways that Python
allows you to control the flow of your code. 

## Topics

- [if...else](https://github.com/mCaballero1224/docs/tree/main/notes/programming/python/control_flow/if_else.py): If else statements; basic, but instrumental
- [ternary operators](https://github.com/mCaballero1224/docs/tree/main/notes/programming/python/control_flow/ternary.py): used to shorted the syntax of the if...else statment
- [loops](https://github.com/mCaballero1224/docs/tree/main/notes/programming/python/control_flow/loops.py): loops are used to perform sections of code multiple times,
usually based on some sort of condition
