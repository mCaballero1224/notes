""" COMPARISON OPERATORS

    Python has six comparison operators:

    - Less than ( < )
    - Less than or equal to ( <= )
    - Greater than ( > )
    - Greater than or equal to ( >= )
    - Equal to ( == )
    - Not equal to ( != )

    Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value,
    either True or False. You can use these operators to compare both
    numbers and strings.
"""

# The following example uses the less than operator ( < ) to compare strings
print('apple' < 'orange')    # Output: True ( 'a' is before 'o' )
print('banana' < 'apple')    # Output: False ( 'b' is after 'a' )
print('banana' == 'banana')  # Output: True ( the two strings match )
print('foo' != 'bar')        # Output: True ( the two strings do not match)
